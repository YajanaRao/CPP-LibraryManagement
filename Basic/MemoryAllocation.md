Here, data-type could be any built-in data type including an array or any user defined data types include class or structure. Let us start with built-in data types. For example we can define a pointer to type double and then request that the memory be allocated at execution time. We can do this using the new operator with the following statements âˆ’

```c++
double* pvalue  = NULL; // Pointer initialized with null
pvalue  = new double;   // Request memory for the variable
```

For array's

```c++
char* pvalue  = NULL;         // Pointer initialized with null
pvalue  = new char[20];  
```
